<h1>A Framework for QA Generation and Answering in a Regulatory Context</h1>

The code in this repository is an addendum to the Masters Thesis Research

1) Setup application configurations in app_config.py as necessary
2) Navigate to src folder and execute qg_run.py for EXPLAIN-QAR question generation and its baseline DR<sub>GEN</sub>
3) Navigate to src folder and execute qg_run.py for GP-QAR question Answering and its baseline DR<sub>ANS</sub>. This will require a ground-truth dataset, we use the one generated by EXPLAIN-QAR

Note: API Keys must be stored in a folder ./keys in the root directory and must be labelled in accordance to the convention laid out in model_dict.py

We use SpAcy for Entity Pathing extraction of lemmatized nounn phrases, please install its model with:
```
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Outputs generated are stored in ./outputs folder 

Files prefixed with qa_ and qg_ relate to question answering and QA generation respectively.
